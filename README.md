# Payroll
This is a RESTful web service for a payroll.<br>
Its purpose is to get started with [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework) and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).<br>
The project is based on [this](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/rest/) guide.

### Getting Started
1. Clone this repo
2. Run ```./mvnw spring-boot:run```
3. Make HTTP requests to http://localhost:8080/employees, eg.: GET /employees/2

This project already has a hot reloading feature, so try to change some code and enjoy it!
